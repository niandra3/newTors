Open a browser with searches for all your favorite TV shows released today.

Meant to be used alongside my companion program, [EpisodeMover](https://github.com/niandra3/EpisodeMover). Leverages the list of your favorite shows from EpisodeMover and checks tvmuse.com to see which of your shows are newly available today. If found, will search your chosen torrent search engine for the shows.

Check config.ini for settings. If you aren't using EpisodeMover and don't have the data.json file that it generates, you can list your favorite shows manually in config.ini.

Do not use this to illegally download anything you don't own the rights to.
